# CantPwnThis
### Password generator created via Swift and SwiftUI. Built for macOS.

Small password generator I created to get more familiar with SwiftUI and designing UI/UX.

CantPwnThis has 4 options of set characters to include in password: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers and Special characters. Password is generated in a text field in a secure way. 
It can be revealed by checking the Reveal toggle checkbox.

Imo, it's a nice application to generate random password for various services and websites.
